  "body": "# Practical Bible Study + Spiritual Formation for the Digital Age\n\nWhen you became a Christian, you were excited to read through your Bible and discover it's wisdom...how to navigate the complexities of life, how to become a kinder person, how to grow closer to God...but your dreams were dashed when you realized that many of the resources are overly scholarly or overly emotional.  There are few places to learn *how* to live out the Christian life. \n\nIn my years as a Christian in ministry, I've noticed that what we need most for personal transformation is *not* more biblical context and information. Or inspiration stories that touch our hearts. We need to know what the Bible says and what it tells us about how to make decisions, develop life-changing habits, and deepen our love for God and others. We need something practical.\n\nBut we need more. \n\nWe need to know how to thrive **in the digital age**. Today we have more articles and blog posts telling us what we should believe, how we should think, and what we should value. We have more distractions. We have more challenges. \n\nAnd we need to know how to navigate them in the midst of this quickly evolving technology. \n\n## Here's where I think I can help. \n\nAfter years in Youth & College ministry, I've discovered that vague principles and emotional stories don't help us grow. I've never gotten into a debate about the context of the gospel of Matthew. But I have been asked about how to live out the sermon on the mount in the midst of social media discussions. \n\nSo I write with the aim to give you some helpful tips, techniques, and tools that will help you grow spiritually in the middle of your tech-saturated life. \n\nReach out via email or twitter with any questions!"
