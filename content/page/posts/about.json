  "body": "When you became a Christian, you were excited to read through your Bible and discover it's wisdom...\n\n...how to navigate the complexities of life,\n\n...how to become a kinder person\n\n...how to grow closer to God...\n\nBut your dreams were dashed when you realized that many of the resources are overly scholarly or overly emotional.  There are few places to learn *how* to live out the Christian life. \n\nIn my years as a Christian in ministry, I've noticed that what we need most for personal transformation is *not* more biblical context and information. Or inspiration stories that touch our hearts. We need to know what the Bible says and what it tells us about how to make decisions, develop life-changing habits, and deepen our love for God and others. \n\nWe need something practical.\n\nWe need to know how to thrive **in the digital age**. Today we have more articles and blog posts telling us what we should believe, how we should think, and what we should value. We have more distractions. We have more challenges. \n\nAnd we need to know how to navigate them in the midst of this quickly evolving technology. \n\n## **Here's where I think I can help.**\n\nI write with the aim to give you some helpful tips, techniques, and tools that will help you grow spiritually in the middle of your tech-saturated life. \n\nMy hope is that in reading here, you will discover:\n\n* How to navigate life's tough decisions with Biblical Wisdom\n* Tips and techniques for integrating your faith into your tech-driven life\n* How to develop life-changing habits \n* How to See Jesus is all of Scripture\n* How to Slow Down in today's fast-pace world\n\nTogether, let's thrive and *\"grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.\"* (2 Peter 3:18)"
