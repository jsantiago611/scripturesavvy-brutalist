Even immature.\n\nWhat trespass have I committed?\n\nReading too fast.\n\nBut why is that so wrong?\n\nWell, for the same reason swallowing a Ferrero Rocher without savoring it is. It’s downright evil. Chocolate deserves more respect.\n\nSo does the Bible.\n\nHere’s what you should do instead:\n\n## ASK 3 QUESTIONS: WHO? WHAT? WHY?\n\nThose are the fundamental parts of a sentence:\n\n1. **Who** refers to the subject that does the action.\n2. **What** refers to the verb.\n3. **Why** refers to the object that receives the action.\n\n## Try it out on Acts 22:14:\n\n1. Who? “*The God of our Fathers*”\n2. What? *“Chosen”* God has chosen us.\n3. Why? “*To know His will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from His mouth*.”\n\nGod chooses His people. God chooses His servants. As Christians, we don’t serve because anyone needs us. Or because there are opportunities to serve. We serve because it is His good pleasure. He has chosen us.\n\nThis tip will transform your study. The next time you read:\n\nSlow.\n\nDown.\n\nAnd ask:\n\nWho? What? Why?\n\nPretty soon you’ll start to see that God is the subject. God is the verb. God is the object. It’s all by Him, through Him, and to Him."
