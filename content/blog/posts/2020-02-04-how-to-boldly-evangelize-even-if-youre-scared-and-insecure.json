It happens after the curtains close, in those intimate one-to-one conversationsâ€¦\n\n...when you ask a heartbroken friend how they are doingâ€¦\n...when you give a buddy a rideâ€¦\nâ€¦ when you comfort a grieving coworkerâ€¦\n...when you're grabbing coffee with a friendâ€¦\n...when your daughter asks for a bedtime storyâ€¦\n\nIt's in those casual conversations , these everyday moments that life change happens and hearts are melted. \n\nThese moments are not flashy or glorious. They are not recorded like sermons are. They'll never be heard by anyone beyond you two.\n\nAnd yet...it doesn't matter.\n\nThe difference between a charismatic Billy Graham and a cowardly Christian who never opens his mouth is not a likable personality or persuasive vocabulary. It's the recognition that everyone matters.\n\nBy sharing your faith with one person in an everyday conversation, you'll build the courage needed to take on the most resilient aitheist with poise and love.\n\nNot even the greatest evangelists of our day started with large crowds. They started by simply speaking to one person at a time, slowly depending on God for strength, courage, words, and insight. \n\nAnd little by little, they became the type of people that were unashamed of the gospel and threw themselves into God's mission without a second thought for their safety or reputation. They became people that God was proud of.\n\nAnd you can be too. Even if you're scared and insecure. \n"
